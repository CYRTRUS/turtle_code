# Turtle Art Generator

A Python program that generates geometric art using turtle graphics. The program creates various patterns with triangles, squares, and pentagons in different configurations and layers by using OOP.

## Features

- **9 Different Art Patterns**: Each option generates unique geometric art
- **Random Colors**: Every shape has randomly generated RGB colors
- **Multiple Layers**: Some patterns feature nested shapes with decreasing sizes
- **Interactive Menu**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **Real-time Drawing**: Watch the art being generated with progressive updates

## Art Options

| Option | Description                                                   | Pattern                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1      | 20-30 random triangles (1 layer each)                         | Single-layer triangles         |
| 2      | 20-30 random squares (1 layer each)                           | Single-layer squares           |
| 3      | 20-30 random pentagons (1 layer each)                         | Single-layer pentagons         |
| 4      | Mixed shapes (7-10 triangles, 7-10 squares, 7-10 pentagons)   | Variety of single-layer shapes |
| 5      | 20-30 random triangles (3 layers each)                        | Nested triangles               |
| 6      | 20-30 random squares (3 layers each)                          | Nested squares                 |
| 7      | 20-30 random pentagons (3 layers each)                        | Nested pentagons               |
| 8      | Mixed shapes with layers (7-10 of each, 3 layers)             | Variety of nested shapes       |
| 9      | Complete mix (2-3 of each shape type with 1, 2, and 3 layers) | All combinations               |

## How to Run

1. **Save the code** to a file named `polygon_art.py`

2. **Run the program** in your terminal/command prompt:
